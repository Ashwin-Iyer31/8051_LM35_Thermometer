# 8051_LM35_Thermometer
Designing a thermometer with 8051 helping us learn to use discrete components such as AT89S52, ADC0804, with Assembly
1.Write the program in the Keil software.<br>
2.Assemble, build and create a .hex file.<br>
3.Now give the connections physically as per the circuit diagram.<br>
4.Burn the hex file to the controller using programmer or any other microcontroller-based development board.<br>
5.Press the Reset Switch since we have opted for manual reset.<br>
6.If any fault occurs, using multimeter measure resistances and capacitances, if they are functioning properly.<br>
7.Check if the display changes values for temperature changes by changing temperature in some way or by simply touching the sensor.<br>

Comments included in the Assembly File explains use of each line.<br>
